            <h3>What Oauth Authenticator?</h3>
            <p>Oath Authenticator is a simple, open source application used for 2-step authentication using the Oauth standard. Oauth is used by many popular websites, such as Google, Live, and Dropbox, to enable an extra layer of security. More information can be found at <a href="http://oauth.net"/>http://oauth.net/</a>.</p>
            <h3>Why did Kurieus make this app?</h3>
            <p>Though other Oauth apps are currently published to the Windows App Store, none of the other apps are released by developers with highly recognized and trusted names. Because of the nature of Oauth, It was not felt that these apps could be trusted. Oauth Authenticator is released to the public as a free and open source application. The source code can be viewed and examined by anyone at its GitHub repository. That repository is located here:<a href="https://github.com/mepis/Windows8OauthAuthenticator"> https://github.com/mepis/Windows8OauthAuthenticator</a>. The source code has been documented as best as possible in an attempt to allow as many people as possible to understand the code.</p>
            <h3>How does Oauth Authenticator secure information?</h3>
            <p>Oauth Authenticator saves all secret keys in the Windows Security Credentials Password Vault. More information of the Security Credentials Password Vault can be found here: <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/what-is-credential-manager">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/what-is-credential-manager</a>.</p>
