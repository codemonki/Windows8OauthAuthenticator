                <h2>What Authenticator?</h2>
                <p>
                    Authenticator is a simple, open source application used for 2-step authentication on Windows 8 and Windows RT.
                    2 step authentication is used by many popular websites, such as Google, Live, and Dropbox, to enable an extra layer of security.
                </p>
                <h2>Why did Kurieus make this app?</h2>
                <p>
                    Though other TOTP authenticator apps are currently published to the Windows App Store,
                    none of the other apps are released by developers with highly recognized and trusted names.
                    Because of the nature of 2 step authentication, It was felt that erring on the side of caution
                    would be best and to not use these apps. Authenticator is released to the public as a free
                    and open source application. The source code can be viewed and examined by anyone at its
                    GitHub repository. That repository is located here:

                <h2>How does Authenticator secure information?</h2>
                <p>
                    Authenticator saves all secret keys in the Windows Security Credentials Password Vault.
                    More information of the Security Credentials Password Vault can be found here:
